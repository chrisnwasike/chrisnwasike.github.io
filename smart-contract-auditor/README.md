# Smart Contract Security Auditor

A free, open-source, AI-powered smart contract security analysis tool that detects critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in Solidity code.

## Features

### Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection

#### Critical Severity
- **Reentrancy Attacks** - Detects call-before-state-update patterns
- **Unprotected Selfdestruct** - Identifies contract destruction functions without access control
- **Unsafe Delegatecall** - Flags delegatecall to untrusted/user-controlled addresses

#### High Severity
- **tx.origin Authentication** - Identifies phishing-vulnerable authorization
- **Unchecked External Calls** - Detects calls without return value validation
- **Missing Access Control** - Finds sensitive functions lacking protection
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow** - Checks for SafeMath usage in pre-0.8.0 contracts
- **Timestamp Manipulation** - Identifies critical logic dependent on block.timestamp
- **Uninitialized Storage Pointers** - Detects potentially dangerous storage references
- **Front-Running Vulnerabilities** - Flags transactions vulnerable to MEV
- **Unsafe ERC20 Operations** - Identifies token transfers without proper checks

## How It Works

The auditor uses pattern matching and static analysis to scan Solidity code for known vulnerability patterns:

1. **Pattern Recognition** - Matches code against database of known vulnerabilities
2. **Context Analysis** - Examines surrounding code to reduce false positives
3. **Severity Classification** - Categorizes findings by risk level
4. **Actionable Recommendations** - Provides specific fixes for each issue

## Usage

1. Paste your Solidity smart contract code into the editor
2. Click "Analyze Contract" or press Ctrl+Enter
3. Review the findings organized by severity
4. Follow the recommendations to fix vulnerabilities

## Example Vulnerabilities

The tool includes 6 pre-loaded examples of vulnerable contracts:
- Reentrancy Attack
- Access Control Issues
- Unchecked External Calls
- tx.origin Authentication
- Unsafe Delegatecall
- Unprotected Selfdestruct

## Technology Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No backend required - runs entirely in the browser
- Regex-based pattern matching
- Context-aware vulnerability detection

## Limitations

This tool provides **automated analysis** and should complement, not replace, professional security audits:

- Pattern matching cannot catch all vulnerability types
- Complex business logic vulnerabilities require manual review
- High-value production contracts need professional audits
- Some findings may be false positives depending on context

## Why This Tool Exists

Traditional smart contract audits cost $50,000-$300,000+, creating a barrier for small projects and independent developers. This tool democratizes access to security analysis by:

- Providing instant feedback during development
- Teaching developers about common vulnerabilities
- Catching low-hanging fruit before professional audits
- Reducing overall security costs

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with AI/LLM for deeper semantic analysis
- Support for more vulnerability types (medium/low severity)
- Gas optimization suggestions
- Integration with development tools (VS Code, Remix)
- Formal verification for critical functions
- Historical exploit database comparison
- Automated test case generation

## Contributing

This is an open-source project. Contributions are welcome:
- Add new vulnerability patterns
- Improve detection accuracy
- Reduce false positives
- Enhance UI/UX
- Add documentation

## Disclaimer

This tool is provided as-is for educational and development purposes. It does not guarantee the security of smart contracts. Always obtain professional security audits for production contracts handling real value.
